## ðŸš¨ If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check Service Logs**: Railway Dashboard â†’ Service â†’ Deployments â†’ View Logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all variables are set correctly
3. **Check Service Health**: All services should show "Active" status
4. **Test API Endpoints**: Use browser or Postman to test backend directly
5. **Redeploy if Needed**: Sometimes a fresh deployment fixes issues
